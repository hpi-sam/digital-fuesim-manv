-   Development builds (the docker container with the `dev` tag) now show the commit hash they have been built from in the version number.
-   The time until the next treatment recalculation for the automatic patient treatment is shown.

### Fixed

-   New patients added to simulated regions during treatment are now also triaged and treated.

## [0.3.0] - 2023-03-27

### Added

-   There are now radiograms, which can be used by the simulation to send messages to the trainees. These are generated automatically by an activity.
    -   There is a radiogram for displaying the material count in a simulated region.
    -   There is a radiogram for displaying the patient count in a simulated region.

## [0.2.1] - 2023-03-11

### Changed

-   Revert previous change: Patients, vehicles, personnel and material inside a simulated region are now deleted, when the simulated region is deleted. For vehicles, personnel, and material, they will only be deleted if all that belong together are in the same simulated region.

### Fixed

-   Exercises in which simulated regions are deleted no longer crash on import due missing patients in the tick action.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-03-10

### Added

-   The popup of a simulated region now has five tabs: _Overview_, _Patients, \_Transfers_, _Hospitals_ and _Behaviors_
    -   The _Overview_ tab allows setting the name of the simulated region and shows the current number of patients, vehicles, personnel and material
    -   The _Patients_ tab lists all patients in the simulated region and allows inspecting their detailed information.
        When clicking on a patient somewhere else in the popup (e.g. in the treat patients behavior details), the patient will be shown in this tab.
    -   The _Transfers_ tab allows setting up transfer connections from/to other simulated regions and/or transfer points
    -   The _Hospitals_ tab allows setting up transfer connections to hospitals
    -   The _Behaviors_ tab allows adding and removing behaviors from simulated regions, inspect their current state and customize their settings
        -   For the assign leader behavior, the type of the currently assigned leader is shown
        -   For the treat patients behavior, the current treatment phase is shown. Additionally the matching from patients to personnel is shown, including information on how many patients are treated by the same personnel at a time and the visible status and progression of the patients. There are also settings for how often the matching is recalculated and how long it takes to count patients.
        -   For the unload arrived vehicles behavior, the unload duration can be set and all currently unloading vehicles are listed with their remaining time
-   To manage exercises with a large amount of simulated regions easily, a large modal has been added that can be used to manage all simulated regions
    -   Every simulated region popup shows a button to view the current simulated region in this modal
-   Simulated Regions now act as transfer points, meaning that they can be start and destination of a transfer
    -   Connection lines will be shown for transfer connections from/to simulated regions, too

### Changed

-   Images are now stored in git and not git lfs anymore
-   Patients, vehicles, personnel and material inside a simulated region are now deleted, when the simulated region is deleted. For vehicles, personnel, and material, they will only be deleted if all that belong together are in the same simulated region.

### Fixed

-   Making a _Gruppenführer_ leader of a simulated region if the region already had a leader did not work. Now, if there already is a leader, better personnel (i.e. the old leader was not a _Gruppenführer_ but the new one is) will be chosen as new leader
-   When a _Gruppenführer_ is leader of a simulated region, the treat patients behavior no longer stops working
-   Errors in migrating exercises lo longer crash the backend
-   If the history of an exercise cannot be restored, it is now dropped and the current state is used
-   Actions that affect vehicles that are not fully loaded will now be removed in migrations, enabling the restoration of most of the history

## [0.1.0] - 2023-03-01

### Added

-   A new team of contributors joined the project!
-   Even better, we are happy to welcome a new partner: Johanniter Akademie NRW, Campus Münster der Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe e.V. (JUH).
-   Simulated regions are new elements on the map that behave similar to viewports.
    -   They have a flexible simulation framework for defining behaviors.
    -   These can contain personnel, vehicles, material and patients.
    -   Several behaviors providing the following automatic behavior already exist (but can't be activated at the moment):
        -   Let personnel leave their vehicle after arriving in a simulated region
        -   Assign a leader for a simulated region
        -   Count, triage and treat patients in a simulated region
-   Added customizable pages for imprint and privacy notice.
-   The frontend now displays the current software version and shows a feedback button on most pages.
-   Added [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md), a [release and versioning guide](./README.md#releases) and release actions.

### Changed

-   Elements that are dragged to the map can be deleted or added to a transfer point directly instead of having to drop and move them.
-   Various internal refactoring:
    -   Marked VS Code configs as examples.
    -   Introduced uniform abstract representation for positions.
    -   Added property for type distinction to all objects in the state.
    -   Moved lots of functionality from `OlMapManager` to feature managers.

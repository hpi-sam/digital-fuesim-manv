# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project does **not** adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Documentation on simulated regions and their behaviors is now available.

### Fixed

- On longer pages, messages were shown outside the viewport.
- When a new vehicle with automatic numbering (#) is added to an exercise, the names of personnel and materials are updated as well.
- The view button of elements cards shown in the marketplace now actually opens the element's details view instead of the duplicate modal.
- Attributes of elements in the marketplace (e.g. name, image) are now properly validated.

## [1.0.0-rc.2] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- A simple ticket system allows tickets to be assigned to patients. A patient who has a ticket assigned shows a ticket icon above them on the map. Tickets do not affect the exercise logic (i.e., patients can be loaded into vehicles and sent to hospitals regardless of their ticket status).
- Trainers can edit the timers and tasks of technical challenges and their templates. Trainers can edit user generated content of technical challenges.
- A default element collection with fire department related content for users to start building fire department scenarios.
- Trainers can upload technical challenge templates which were created using an external editor.

### Fixed

- The help link in the footer now works.

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Organisations were introduced for managing content together with other users. It's possible to manage several organisations and invite other users to them.
- Exercise element collections were introduced to manage and share exercise elements (e.g., vehicles, alarm groups, etc.) outside of exercises.
- With technical challenges, it is now possible to include dynamically changing situations like technical rescue or fire extinguishing. To solve them, participants can assign personnel and give them pre-defined tasks. Currently, there are two premade technical challenges. This feature will be extended with an editor in a later software version to enable trainers to create their own challenges.
- Measures were added to allow trainers to configure several global actions that participants can take (e.g., giving a status report, drawing a danger zone, requesting additional units).
- There is now a banner that is displayed when the application is unable to start properly, informing the user about potential causes.
- New participants joining a parallel exercise after it started now get fast-forwarded to be in sync with all other participants.
- Users can now export all their user-related data when logged in.
- Exercises and exercise templates can be exported from the exercise manager.
- It is possible to export all exercises/exercise templates in an organisation as a ZIP file.

### Changed

- Menu items in header are now in a more logical order.
- The parallel exercise overview page is now structured with tabs.
- Exercises, exercises templates, and parallel exercises are no longer coupled to a user, but to an organisation. Each user therefore has a private organisation for their personal content.
- When participants view scoutables, this is tracked and shown to the trainer with a green speech bubble/magnifying glass. Also, the information appears in the log.

### Fixed

- Elements are now only marked scoutable once their name or content is specified, and can be marked as not scoutable again.
- Show exercise import validation error messages in a readable format.
- Exercise instances in a parallel exercise are now created based on the state the exercise template was in when the parallel exercise was created.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Add informational banner to the landing page.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Names of new vehicle are automatically numbered using a counter per vehicle template. This can be en-/disabled using the '#' placeholder in the default name.

### Fixed

- Complete exports (including history) of exercise templates are now permitted.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-23

### Changed

- Anonymous exercises are automatically deleted, if they are unused for a configurable amount of days.

### Fixed

- Locking the map zoom now also disables zooming in by double clicking/tapping on the map.
- Participants, who are restricted to a viewport can again see all vehicles that arrive in their viewport. Due to a bug, vehicles were invisible if the vehicle status display or load times were used in an exercise.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Vehicles can have load times per patient. While a patient is being loaded into the vehicle, it cannot be moved or transferred and no second patient can be loaded at the same time. Load times can be configured per vehicle template and can be disabled globally. While the load time is running, a countdown is shown above the vehicle.

### Changed

- Replace `fuesim-manv.de` links with `fuesim.digital`
- Help pages are linked in landing page footer

### Fixed

- The naming has been unified to use "Alarmgruppe" instead of a mix of "Alarmgruppe" and "Alarmierungsgruppe".

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Trainers can configure whether participants can use the button to completely load a vehicle. To ensure backwards compatibility, loading a patient into a vehicle will for now still automatically load all personnel and material, independent from whether the button is active.
- Trainers can configure whether related elements such as the personnel of a vehicle should be highlighted when one of the elements is selected. Highlighting can be turned off, activated for trainers only (default, matches previous behavior), or activated for both trainers and participants.
- In the parallel exercise overview, a button to copy the participant link to the clipboard has been added.

### Changed

- Trainers now have access to the 'Einsatzübersicht' in Exercises and Exercise Templates.
- Clients now automatically rejoin the exercise with the same view and role when disconnecting due to network issues/reloads.
- Participants no longer see a button to export the current exercise.

### Fixed

- The server no longer crashes on startup when using `DFM_USE_DB=false`
- The server no longer freezes when creating a new exercise from a template with `DFM_USE_DB=false`
- Add missing entries in release notes
- Fix some links in documentation
- Trainers can now drag elements from the sidebar onto the map on touch devices as well.
- Stored exercises that changed are no longer corrupted on server restart.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Previously created templates are now correctly recognized as templates when editing.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Add documentation for most features and integrate it with the software.
- Zooming the map via touch input can be disabled by both trainers and participants per device. This helps preventing accidental zooming if multiple participants are working on a single device simultaneously.

### Changed

- In the client overview table, the following has been renamed for more consistency: 'Rolle' to 'Modus', 'Ansicht' to 'Kartenansicht', 'nicht zugewiesen' to 'Gesamte Karte'.
- Exercises can be directly created when editing exercise templates.
- Templates can be directly deleted when editing them.

### Fixed

- Creating a parallel exercise with many (>10) exercise instances no longer slows down the server significantly.
- Massively reduce the server start up time with many exercises.
- Old exercise exports don't fail the validation anymore
- Exercises can no longer be accidentally started from the simulation overview.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- Deleting exercise templates which have exercise instances doesn't crash the server anymore.
- Malformed database entries are no longer created when an exercise import fails.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- Map tile servers can now be selected from a list of suggested servers
- Alarm groups can now be sent when preparing an exercise template.
- Vehicles in transfer can now be managed when preparing an exercise template.

### Changed

- Extend patients export for IVENA MANV with new fields (e. g. location).
- Docker Images are now pushed exclusively to GHCR. Images on Dockerhub are no longer updated. If you're selfhosting and still using the `digitalfuesimmanv/dfm` image, please switch to `ghcr.io/hpi-sam/fuesim-digital`.

### Fixed

- `DFM_UPLOAD_LIMIT` values are now correctly applied again, after a bug in version 0.11.0
- The vehicle status display now uses the correct visible status of a patient. Thus, after a patient that has been triaged by personnel on the map, the color determined in this triage is used.
- Permissions for multiple actions around simulated regions that were mistakenly allowed for participants have been changed to trainers only.
- The exercise map now fits on mobile device screens
- Vehicles inside a simulated region can now be properly selected again
- Vehicles inside simulated regions are now shown inside the "operations detail view"
- Exercise instances that are part of a parallel exercise no longer get paused when all participants have left, i.e. due to connection issues. This ensures that all instances stay synchronized.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- Migrating old exercises failed in some cases and was very slow.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Provide CSV export for patients to import them into IVENA MANV.
- Enable users to login with SSO via an OpenID Connect providers.
- Restricted Zones can be used to limit the number of vehicles that can be placed in a specific area. The restrictions can be applied per vehicle template.
- Vehicles on the map have an indicator that shows the number of occupied and total patient slots. This indicator is disabled by default and can be enabled for an exercise. Optionally, the indicator is drawn in the status color of the most urgent patient in the vehicle.
- Add exercise manager to allow logged-in users to manage their own exercises and exercise templates.
- Alarm groups can now be limited to a maximum number of activations. When the limit is reached, the alarm group cannot be sent anymore.
- Docker images are now also available on GHCR.
- Add a new role "Einsatzübersicht" ("operations detail view") that simulates the view of a tablet device used by operation commanders on site
    - Add view to manage on-location vehicles in operational sections
    - Add overview map with 3D view and on-location-vehicles as well as in-transfer-vehicles list
- Add scoutable elements: Patients and map images now have a new tab "Erkundung" for scouting information. Trainers can edit rich text for scoutables and toggle visibility for participants.
    - Add an indicator to scoutable elements on the map, which leads directly to the scouting tab.
    - Add some presets for simple bystanders and scoutable elements (tab "Erkundung" in the map editor).

### Changed

- Improve hints for exercise settings.
- Add hints for transfer point settings.
- The Docker image of the software has been redesigned, including the following breaking changes:
    - TLS handling has been dropped from the image. Please use a separate reverse proxy for TLS. The variables `DFM_ENABLE_SSL`, `DFM_ENABLE_HSTS`, and `DFM_FORCE_NEW_SSL_CERTS` have no effect and the container only accepts connections on port 80.
    - With the removal of TLS handling, the application container does not need a volume any longer. The variable `DFM_PERSISTENT_DATA_PATH` has been removed.
    - The `DFM_UPLOAD_LIMIT` variable now supports custom units. For the previous behavior (megabytes), please append a "m" suffix.
    - Assets have to be mounted to `/usr/local/app/frontend/assets/about` (dropped `dist/digital-fuesim-manv` from the path).
    - Several other internal changes to the container, especially the nginx configuration. If you relied on overwriting config files for your setup, please review the code diff.
- Show large, non-dismissable modal if the connection to the server got lost.
- Add modal for inviting participants and trainers via QR codes.
- Participants and trainers are now consistently called "Teilnehmende" and "Übungsleitende", respectively, in the frontend.
- Exercise keys are now consistently called "Übungs-PIN", "Teilnehmenden-PIN" and "Übungsleitungs-PIN" in the frontend.
- Use PostgreSQL 18 as default database. Please ensure to update your production database.

### Fixed

- Viewports are now consistently called "Ansicht" in the frontend and some other incorrect usages of "Einsatzabschnitt" have been corrected.
- The map is now visible again in replay mode.
- Participants can now only use the emergency operations center if the exercise is running.

## [0.10.0] - 2025-12-08

### Added

- Trainees can mark patients for transport priority. Those patients show a red outline around their popup.
- Participants can now be assigned to an emergency operations view, allowing them to send alarm groups and write public messages to the emergency operations center log.
- The emergency operations center log now differentiates between public messages and private messages only visible to trainers.
- From the simulated region pop-up, a visual overview of all objects inside the region can be opened as a modal.

### Changed

- The design of the map editor has been slightly updated: It consumes less space and is more consistent.
- Some texts shown in the frontend have been added or reworded to be easier to understand.

### Fixed

  possible to set custom QR code contents for each patient to support complexer systems.
- Berliner Feuerwehr is now mentioned as member of the project consortium.
- There is a dedicated view for "interface signallers" to participate in an exercise with simulated regions. Interface signallers can request information from simulated regions on behalf of the incident command and forward instructions back to the simulated regions.

### Fixed

- When moving an element on the map fails, the element will now be moved back to its previous location
- The transfer overview now uses the names of the personnel types instead of their internal abbreviations
- When requesting the transport progress while there are no regions to manage the transport of, the report now correctly reports zero patients instead of crashing

## [0.8.1] - 2025-04-29

### Fixed

- Imports of exercise once again can be performed in the frontend
- Material and Personnel from vehicles that were sent trough an alarm group can now be interacted with again

## [0.8.0] - 2025-04-14

### Added

## [0.2.1] - 2023-03-11

### Changed

- Revert previous change: Patients, vehicles, personnel and material inside a simulated region are now deleted, when the simulated region is deleted. For vehicles, personnel, and material, they will only be deleted if all that belong together are in the same simulated region.

### Fixed

- Exercises in which simulated regions are deleted no longer crash on import due missing patients in the tick action.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-03-10

### Added

- The popup of a simulated region now has five tabs: _Overview_, _Patients, \_Transfers_, _Hospitals_ and _Behaviors_
    - The _Overview_ tab allows setting the name of the simulated region and shows the current number of patients, vehicles, personnel and material
    - The _Patients_ tab lists all patients in the simulated region and allows inspecting their detailed information.
      When clicking on a patient somewhere else in the popup (e.g. in the treat patients behavior details), the patient will be shown in this tab.
    - The _Transfers_ tab allows setting up transfer connections from/to other simulated regions and/or transfer points
    - The _Hospitals_ tab allows setting up transfer connections to hospitals
    - The _Behaviors_ tab allows adding and removing behaviors from simulated regions, inspect their current state and customize their settings
        - For the assign leader behavior, the type of the currently assigned leader is shown
        - For the treat patients behavior, the current treatment phase is shown. Additionally the matching from patients to personnel is shown, including information on how many patients are treated by the same personnel at a time and the visible status and progression of the patients. There are also settings for how often the matching is recalculated and how long it takes to count patients.
        - For the unload arrived vehicles behavior, the unload duration can be set and all currently unloading vehicles are listed with their remaining time
- To manage exercises with a large amount of simulated regions easily, a large modal has been added that can be used to manage all simulated regions
    - Every simulated region popup shows a button to view the current simulated region in this modal
- Simulated Regions now act as transfer points, meaning that they can be start and destination of a transfer
    - Connection lines will be shown for transfer connections from/to simulated regions, too

### Changed

- Images are now stored in git and not git lfs anymore
- Patients, vehicles, personnel and material inside a simulated region are now deleted, when the simulated region is deleted. For vehicles, personnel, and material, they will only be deleted if all that belong together are in the same simulated region.

### Fixed

- Making a _Gruppenführer_ leader of a simulated region if the region already had a leader did not work. Now, if there already is a leader, better personnel (i.e. the old leader was not a _Gruppenführer_ but the new one is) will be chosen as new leader
- When a _Gruppenführer_ is leader of a simulated region, the treat patients behavior no longer stops working
- Errors in migrating exercises lo longer crash the backend
- If the history of an exercise cannot be restored, it is now dropped and the current state is used
- Actions that affect vehicles that are not fully loaded will now be removed in migrations, enabling the restoration of most of the history

## [0.1.0] - 2023-03-01

### Added

- A new team of contributors joined the project!
- Even better, we are happy to welcome a new partner: Johanniter Akademie NRW, Campus Münster der Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe e.V. (JUH).
- Simulated regions are new elements on the map that behave similar to viewports.
    - They have a flexible simulation framework for defining behaviors.
    - These can contain personnel, vehicles, material and patients.
    - Several behaviors providing the following automatic behavior already exist (but can't be activated at the moment):
        - Let personnel leave their vehicle after arriving in a simulated region
        - Assign a leader for a simulated region
        - Count, triage and treat patients in a simulated region
- Added customizable pages for imprint and privacy notice.
- The frontend now displays the current software version and shows a feedback button on most pages.
- Added [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md), a [release and versioning guide](./README.md#releases) and release actions.

### Changed

- Elements that are dragged to the map can be deleted or added to a transfer point directly instead of having to drop and move them.
- Various internal refactoring:
    - Marked VS Code configs as examples.
    - Introduced uniform abstract representation for positions.
    - Added property for type distinction to all objects in the state.
    - Moved lots of functionality from `OlMapManager` to feature managers.
    - Improved pipeline and branch protection

### Fixed

 * This directive focuses the element once after it has been initialized.

 * Use it like this:
 *
 * ```html
 * <input type="text" [appAutofocus]="true" />
 * ```
 *
 * @param appAutofocus Whether to focus the element or not (to conditionally enable or disable it).
 *
 * If multiple autofocus directives are used on elements, that are loaded at the same time, it leads to a race condition.
